### **🚀 Quick Project Launch**

Choose your preferred development approach:

<details>
<summary><strong>🤖 With AI Coding Agents (Recommended - Natural Language)</strong></summary>

```bash
# 1. Clone repository (terminal/command prompt)
git clone https://github.com/pingwu/multi-ai-coding-agent.git
cd multi-ai-coding-agent

# 2. Start Claude Code (or your preferred AI coding agent)
# Windows: Start WSL shell first (wsl) then run:
claude

# 3-5. Use Natural Language Commands:
```
**💬 Just tell your AI agent what you want:**
- `"Please bring up project 1"` → AI sets up and starts content generator
- `"Bring up content generation servers"` → AI handles environment and Docker
- `"Start the expense tracker project"` → AI configures and launches project 2
- `"Set up my API keys for the content generator"` → AI guides secure configuration
- `"Fix any startup issues"` → AI troubleshoots and resolves problems

**✅ Result: Running in under 15 minutes through conversation!**
