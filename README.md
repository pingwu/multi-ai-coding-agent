## 🛠️ Tech Stack

All projects follow a consistent, modern architecture:

-   **Backend:** Python, CrewAI, FastAPI
-   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
-   **Deployment:** Docker, Docker Compose

## 🧰 Troubleshooting

See common fixes and tips in `setup/troubleshooting.md`.

- Bind mounts and live updates: When editing files in bind-mounted folders (e.g., Project 2's `./data` mapped to `/app/data`), changes are reflected immediately in running containers. Refresh the UI or rerun the request to see updates. If changes don't appear, restart that project's containers.

## 💬 Development Philosophy

Our goal is to democratize AI development. We believe you should be able to build powerful AI systems by describing what you want in plain English. These projects are designed to be understood, customized, and scaled using conversational AI development tools.

For a deeper dive into the architecture and development patterns, see our [**Development Guide (CLAUDE.md)**](./CLAUDE.md).

## 🤝 Contributing

- PRs welcome. Keep them small and focused.
- Follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.).
- Use Docker + Make targets; do not run Python on the host.
- For larger changes, open an issue first to discuss direction.
- Code of Conduct: contact ping@ping-ai.com for any concerns.

### Git Hooks (Secret Guardrails)
- Enable repo-managed hooks to prevent accidental secret commits:
  - `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`
- What it blocks by default:
  - Any `.env` files (`.env`, `.env.*`)
  - Any `credentials/*.json` (e.g., Google service accounts)
  - Private key files (`*.pem`, `*.key`)
  - Staged content containing markers like `OPENAI_API_KEY=`, `service_account`, or `private_key`
- To bypass (not recommended), set `HOOK_BYPASS=1` for a single commit.
