```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Traditional Development"
        A1[Learn Framework] --> B1[Write Code Manually] 
        B1 --> C1[Debug for Hours]
        C1 --> D1[Stack Overflow Research]
        D1 --> E1[Finally Working App]
    end

    subgraph "AI-Augmented Development"
        A2[Describe What You Want] --> B2[AI Agent Generates Code]
        B2 --> C2[Review & Refine with AI]
        C2 --> D2[Deploy in Minutes]
        D2 --> E2[Production-Ready App]
    end

    E1 -.->|"Weeks Later"| F1[Basic Portfolio]
    E2 -.->|"Days Later"| F2[Professional Portfolio]
```

**The difference:** You focus on **architecture and problem-solving** while AI handles the implementation details.
