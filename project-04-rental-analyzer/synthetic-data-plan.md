## üìä **Financial Modeling Framework**

### **Core Financial Calculations**

#### **1. Cash-on-Cash Return**
```python
def cash_on_cash_return(annual_cash_flow, initial_investment):
    """
    Measures annual pre-tax cash flow as percentage of initial investment
    Industry benchmark: 8-12% is good for rental properties
    """
    return (annual_cash_flow / initial_investment) * 100

# Example: $3,600 annual cash flow / $45,000 down payment = 8%
```

#### **2. Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)**
```python
def cap_rate(net_operating_income, property_value):
    """
    Measures property profitability independent of financing
    Industry benchmark: 4-10% depending on market and risk
    """
    return (net_operating_income / property_value) * 100

# Example: $18,000 NOI / $300,000 value = 6% cap rate
```

#### **3. Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM)**
```python
def gross_rent_multiplier(property_price, annual_rent):
    """
    Quick valuation metric - lower is generally better
    Industry benchmark: 4-7 is favorable for investors
    """
    return property_price / annual_rent

# Example: $300,000 price / $28,800 rent = 10.4 GRM (high)
```

#### **4. Net Operating Income (NOI)**
```python
def net_operating_income(gross_rent, operating_expenses):
    """
    Annual rental income minus operating expenses (no debt service)
    Key metric for property valuation and investment analysis
    """
    return gross_rent - operating_expenses

# Operating expenses include: taxes, insurance, maintenance, vacancy allowance
```

#### **5. Total Return on Investment**
```python
def total_roi(annual_cash_flow, principal_paydown, appreciation, initial_investment):
    """
    Comprehensive return including cash flow, equity buildup, and appreciation
    Shows complete investment performance picture
    """
    total_annual_return = annual_cash_flow + principal_paydown + appreciation
    return (total_annual_return / initial_investment) * 100
```

### **Advanced Financial Models**

#### **10-Year Investment Projection**
```python
class RentalPropertyProjection:
    def __init__(self, property_data):
        self.property = property_data
        self.years = 10
        
    def calculate_projection(self):
        projection = []
        for year in range(1, self.years + 1):
            # Rent increases (inflation + market growth)
            current_rent = self.property.rent * (1 + 0.03) ** year
            
            # Property appreciation
            current_value = self.property.value * (1 + self.property.appreciation_rate/100) ** year
            
            # Mortgage paydown (if financed)
            remaining_balance = self.calculate_mortgage_balance(year)
            equity = current_value - remaining_balance
            
            projection.append({
                'year': year,
                'rent': current_rent,
                'value': current_value,
                'equity': equity,
                'cash_flow': self.calculate_cash_flow(current_rent),
                'total_return': self.calculate_total_return(year)
            })
        return projection
```
