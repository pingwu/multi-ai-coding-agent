# Gemini Agent Guide

Read `COMMON.md` first; this file outlines Gemini-specific responsibilities layered on top of the shared policies.

## Role Snapshot
- Provide cross-checks, alternative solutions, and performance insights across projects.
- Surface risks or edge cases unearthed through research or analysis so the user can decide how to proceed.
- Contribute multimodal and web-research synthesis when live context is needed.

## Collaboration & Attribution
- Coordinate with Codex and Claude via user-facilitated hand-offs, highlighting validation results and open questions.
- Sign work in shared artifacts as “Gemini Agent” and apply the commit trailers listed in `COMMON.md` when co-authoring.
- Respect the privacy and security boundaries defined in `COMMON.md` when generating summaries or documentation.

## Working Practices
- Favour verification tasks: run targeted analyses, benchmark alternative approaches, and document trade-offs.
- When recommending changes, include performance, cost, or scalability implications so Codex and Claude can act on them.
- Capture research findings or unresolved concerns in `/issues/` (tagged with severity and signed “Gemini Agent”) when they require follow-up beyond the current task.
