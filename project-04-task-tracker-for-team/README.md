# 👥 Project 4: AI Task Tracker for Teams - OAuth & Accountability

**Enterprise Team Collaboration with Google OAuth SSO and Audit Trails**

Transform scattered team ideas into focused collaboration using AI agents, Google OAuth authentication, and comprehensive accountability tracking.

---

## 🎯 **Business Case & Problem Statement**

### The "Two-Pizza Team" Challenge
Small teams (5-8 people) struggle with:
- **Ideas all over the place** - no central focus mechanism
- **Accountability gaps** - unclear who did what when
- **Context switching** - losing track of task ownership
- **Manual coordination** - too much overhead for small teams

### Project 4 Solution
AI-powered task management with **individual accountability** that helps teams **stay focused** while learning **enterprise-grade authentication patterns**.

---

## 📌 **Use Case: Real Team Coordination**

### Target Scenario
**Marketing team at a startup** preparing for product launch:
- **Sarah (Team Lead)**: Needs visibility into who's doing what
- **Mike (Designer)**: Working on landing page mockups
- **Lisa (Copywriter)**: Creating email campaign content
- **Jake (Developer)**: Implementing tracking pixels
- **Ana (Analyst)**: Setting up conversion metrics

### Current Pain Points
```
❌ "Who was supposed to update the landing page copy?"
❌ "When did we decide to change the campaign timeline?"
❌ "Why did the tracking setup get delayed?"
❌ "Who has the latest version of the email templates?"
```

### Project 4 Solution
```
✅ "Sarah assigned landing page copy to Lisa on Monday 2PM"
✅ "Mike updated timeline in task #T-4567 with reason: client feedback"
✅ "Jake marked tracking as blocked due to API key delays - see audit trail"
✅ "Ana created email templates v3 - all versions tracked with timestamps"
```

## 🔐 **Key Learning Objectives (Enterprise Skills)**

### 1. **Google OAuth 2.0 Implementation**
**Why Critical**: Every enterprise application needs secure authentication
- OAuth flow implementation from scratch
- Token management and refresh patterns
- User profile and session handling
- Security best practices and PKCE

### 2. **Audit Trail Design**
**Why Critical**: Compliance and accountability are business requirements
- Complete change tracking (who, what, when, why)
- Audit log design and implementation
- Business reporting from audit data
- Data governance and retention

### 3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
**Why Critical**: Enterprise applications require permission management
- Team membership and invitation systems
- Granular permission design
- Role-based API security
- User context propagation

### 4. **Multi-User Data Architecture**
**Why Critical**: Understanding shared data patterns
- User attribution in all operations
- Conflict resolution and concurrency
- Team coordination patterns
- Real-time collaboration features
