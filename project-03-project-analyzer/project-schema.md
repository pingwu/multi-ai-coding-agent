### **Sample Project Data**
```
TASK_001 | Setup development environment | COMPLETED | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-03 | John Smith | | HIGH | 100 | 8 | 6 | DEVELOPMENT | Went faster than expected
TASK_002 | Design database schema | IN_PROGRESS | 2024-01-04 | 2024-01-10 | Sarah Johnson | TASK_001 | HIGH | 75 | 16 | 14 | DESIGN | Need to review with client
TASK_003 | Implement user authentication | NOT_STARTED | 2024-01-11 | 2024-01-18 | Mike Chen | TASK_002 | HIGH | 0 | 24 | 0 | DEVELOPMENT | Blocked by schema completion
TASK_004 | Create landing page | IN_PROGRESS | 2024-01-08 | 2024-01-15 | Lisa Wang | | MEDIUM | 60 | 12 | 8 | DEVELOPMENT | Good progress
TASK_005 | Write API documentation | NOT_STARTED | 2024-01-19 | 2024-01-25 | Alex Brown | TASK_003 | LOW | 0 | 8 | 0 | DOCS | Can start after auth is done
```

## üîç **Risk Assessment Analysis Types**

### **1. Timeline Risk Analysis**
```python
RISK_FACTORS = {
    'OVERDUE_TASKS': 'Tasks past due date',
    'DEADLINE_PRESSURE': 'Tasks due within 3 days with <80% progress', 
    'DEPENDENCY_BOTTLENECKS': 'Critical path dependencies not started',
    'RESOURCE_CONFLICTS': 'Same person assigned to overlapping critical tasks',
    'SCOPE_CREEP': 'Actual hours significantly exceeding estimates'
}
```

### **2. Resource Risk Assessment**
- **Workload Distribution**: Who has too many tasks?
- **Single Points of Failure**: Critical tasks assigned to one person
- **Skill Gap Analysis**: Tasks assigned to wrong expertise level

### **3. Progress Risk Indicators**
- **Velocity Tracking**: Are estimates realistic?
- **Completion Patterns**: Which categories consistently run over?
- **Dependency Chain Analysis**: What happens if key tasks delay?

## ü§ñ **CrewAI Risk Analysis Agents**

### **Agent 1: Timeline Analyzer**
- **Role**: Project Timeline Risk Specialist
- **Goal**: Identify schedule risks and critical path issues
- **Backstory**: Former project manager with experience in software delivery deadlines

### **Agent 2: Resource Analyst**  
- **Role**: Team Capacity and Workload Expert
- **Goal**: Assess resource allocation and identify bottlenecks
- **Backstory**: Operations manager who optimizes team productivity and prevents burnout

### **Agent 3: Risk Assessor**
- **Role**: Project Risk Management Consultant  
- **Goal**: Generate actionable recommendations to mitigate identified risks
- **Backstory**: Consultant who has saved dozens of projects from failure

## üìä **Analysis Reports Generated**

### **1. Executive Dashboard**
```
üö® HIGH RISK ITEMS (3)
‚ö†Ô∏è  MEDIUM RISK ITEMS (5)  
‚úÖ ON TRACK ITEMS (12)

üìà Project Health Score: 72/100
üéØ Estimated Completion: 2024-02-15 (+5 days delay risk)
üë• Team Utilization: 85% (optimal range)
```

### **2. Risk Detail Report**
```
üö® CRITICAL RISKS:
- TASK_003: Authentication blocked by schema delay (3 days overdue)
- Sarah Johnson: Overallocated (120% capacity next week)
- Dependency Chain: 5 tasks waiting on TASK_002 completion

‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM RISKS:
- TASK_004: Landing page 40% behind schedule
- Estimation Accuracy: Development tasks averaging 125% of estimates
```

### **3. Actionable Recommendations**
```
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Prioritize TASK_002 completion (assign additional developer)
2. Break TASK_003 into smaller parallel tasks
3. Move TASK_005 to different team member

PREVENTIVE MEASURES:
1. Review estimation process for development tasks
2. Add buffer time to dependency chains
3. Weekly capacity planning meetings
```
