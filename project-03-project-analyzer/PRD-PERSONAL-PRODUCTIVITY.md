### **üåê F5: Google Cloud Platform Integration** 
**User Story**: *"As a student learning cloud technologies, I want hands-on experience with GCP tools while building something personally useful."*

**Technical Learning Focus**:
- **Google Sheets API**: Read/write task data programmatically
- **Google Cloud CLI**: Setup and authentication via command line
- **Service Account Management**: Secure API access patterns
- **Google Cloud Functions**: Potential for serverless task processing
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Backup and historical data storage

**CLI-First Setup Approach**:
```bash
# Install Google Cloud CLI
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
exec -l $SHELL  # Restart shell

# Authenticate and setup project
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project your-productivity-project

# Create service account for app
gcloud iam service-accounts create productivity-app \
    --display-name="Personal Productivity Assistant"

# Generate and download credentials
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/productivity-credentials.json \
    --iam-account=productivity-app@your-productivity-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com

# Enable required APIs
gcloud services enable sheets.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable drive.googleapis.com
```

**Why CLI-First Approach**:
- **Educational Value**: Students learn professional cloud workflows
- **Reproducible Setup**: Commands can be scripted and shared
- **Coding Agent Friendly**: AI agents can help debug CLI commands
- **Professional Skills**: Mirror real workplace cloud development practices
