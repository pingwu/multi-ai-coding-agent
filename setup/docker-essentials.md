# Docker Essentials - What You Need to Know

## What is Docker? (In Plain English)
Think of Docker like **shipping containers** for software:
- Your app runs the same way on your laptop, my laptop, and in production
- No more "it works on my machine" problems
- Industry standard for professional development

## 4 Commands That Do Everything

### 1. Start Your App
```bash
docker-compose up
```
**What it does**: Starts all your AI services  
**When to use**: Every time you want to run your project

### 2. Stop Your App  
```bash
docker-compose down
```
**What it does**: Cleanly stops all services  
**When to use**: When you're done working

### 3. Rebuild After Changes
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
**What it does**: Rebuilds containers with your latest code changes  
**When to use**: After you modify code

### 4. See What's Running
```bash
docker ps
```
**What it does**: Shows active containers  
**When to use**: When troubleshooting

## Key Concepts (2-Minute Version)

**Container** = Your app + all its dependencies in one package  
**Image** = Template for creating containers  
**docker-compose.yml** = Recipe for your entire app stack  
**.env file** = Secret keys and configuration  

## Why Docker for AI Development?

‚úÖ **Consistent Environment**: Your AI app runs the same everywhere  
‚úÖ **Easy Deployment**: Same container runs locally and in production  
‚úÖ **Professional Standard**: 90%+ of companies use containers  
‚úÖ **No Conflicts**: Each project has its own isolated environment  

## What You Don't Need to Know (Yet)
