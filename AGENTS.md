# Repository Guidelines

## Multi-Agent Collaboration
- Coordinate with Claude and Gemini by reading `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md`; these files describe how our roles complement one another in the multi-AI workflow.
- Identify your contributions as the "Codex Agent" in shared artifacts, reviews, and commit messages so teammates can trace authorship.
- When reviewing or checking code, follow the collaboration protocol documented in `CLAUDE.md`, mirror its review etiquette, and call out that feedback originates from the Codex Agent.
- Surface alternative approaches or risks for the user to decide, and leave space for Claude and Gemini to add perspective during later passes.

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Keep each project in its own `project-<nn>-<slug>/` directory; examples include `project-01-content-generator/` and `project-03-task-tracker/`. Backend and frontend code live inside those project folders following the starter layout (backend `app/` or `src/`, frontend `frontend/` when present). Tests sit alongside their services (`backend/tests/`, `frontend/src/__tests__/`). Shared setup utilities and agent docs (`setup/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`) remain at the repo root; avoid editing the `*-INTERNAL/` references unless instructed.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Development happens in Docker via the top-level `Makefile`. Typical flows: `make -C project-01-content-generator up` to start services, `make -C project-02-expense-tracker logs` to tail containers, and `make -C project-03-project-analyzer down` to stop everything. Use `make rebuild` inside a project when dependencies change. Never run Python or Node commands directly on the hostâ€”run them through these Make targets so environments stay consistent.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Follow expressive, intention-revealing names. Python modules use 4-space indentation, `snake_case` functions, `PascalCase` classes, and type hints where practical; format with Black/Ruff when configured. JavaScript/TypeScript files use 2 spaces, `camelCase` symbols, `PascalCase` React components, and Prettier/ESLint defaults from each project. Keep new files ASCII unless a project already uses Unicode.

## Testing Guidelines
Adopt TDD: add a failing test before implementation, commit once it passes. Run backend suites with `make -C <project> test-backend`, frontend checks with `make -C <project> test-frontend`. Name tests to describe behaviour (e.g., `test_generates_content_preview`). Target the existing coverage gate in each project and add fixtures beside the tests that use them.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Use Conventional Commits such as `feat: add expense aggregation API` or `fix: correct generator prompt`. Keep PRs focused, include context, logs or screenshots when UI changes, and link to tracking issues where available. Rebase or merge from `main` frequently to avoid drift and ensure CI stays green before requesting review.

## Commit Attribution
- Follow GitHub's co-author best practices by using commit trailers for every AI collaborator.
- When Codex Agent contributes materially to a change that lands in this open-source workspace, append two trailers to the commit message footer:
  - `ðŸ¤– Generated with [Codex CLI](https://platform.openai.com/)`
  - `Co-Authored-By: Codex Agent <noreply@openai.com>`
- Preserve trailers for Claude (`Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`) and Gemini (`Co-Authored-By: Gemini Agent <noreply@google.com>`) or any others that participated so history reflects the full multi-agent team.
- Skip commit templates for this; add or amend the trailers only on the commits Codex actually touched.

## Security & Configuration Tips
Copy `.env.example` files before running services, keep real credentials out of version control, and rotate secrets immediately if exposed. Default CORS targets `http://localhost`; adjust only through Compose or env vars. Prefer non-root containers, redact user input from logs unless a debug flag is set, and sanitise any sample data before sharing.
