# Deployment Options: Cloud Run vs. App Engine

When it comes to deploying containerized applications on Google Cloud, both Cloud Run and App Engine (Flexible Environment) are excellent serverless options. Hereâ€™s a comparison to help you decide which is best for your teaching purposes.

## Cloud Run

Cloud Run is a fully managed serverless platform that enables you to run stateless containers that are invocable via web requests or Pub/Sub events. It is built on top of Knative, an open-source Kubernetes-based platform.

### What I Would Do for This Project with Cloud Run

For this project, I would take the following steps to deploy to Cloud Run:

1.  **Containerize the Application:** Create a `Dockerfile` for the application.
2.  **Build the Container:** Use Cloud Build to build the container image and push it to Artifact Registry.
3.  **Deploy to Cloud Run:** Deploy the container image to Cloud Run, configuring it to:
    *   Expose the correct port (e.g., 8080).
    *   Inject the OAuth credentials from Secret Manager as environment variables.
    *   Configure the service to allow public (unauthenticated) access so that end-users can access the web application.

### Why Cloud Run is a Good Choice

*   **Simplicity:** Cloud Run has a very simple and intuitive developer experience. You can deploy a container with a single command.
*   **Pay-per-use:** You only pay when your code is running, down to the nearest 100 milliseconds. It can also scale to zero, meaning you pay nothing if the service is not in use.
*   **Flexibility:** You can run any language or library in any container, as long as it can be started with an HTTP request.

## App Engine (Flexible Environment)

App Engine is a fully managed, serverless platform for developing and hosting web applications at scale. The Flexible Environment runs your application in a Docker container on a Compute Engine virtual machine (VM).

### What I Would Do for This Project with App Engine

1.  **Containerize the Application:** Create a `Dockerfile` for the application.
2.  **Create `app.yaml`:** Create an `app.yaml` file to configure the App Engine service. This file would specify:
    *   The runtime (`custom` for a custom container).
    *   The environment variables for the OAuth credentials (referencing the secrets in Secret Manager).
    *   Network settings.
3.  **Deploy to App Engine:** Deploy the application using `gcloud app deploy`.

### Why App Engine is a Good Choice

*   **Fully Managed:** App Engine handles all the infrastructure for you, including auto-scaling, load balancing, and health checks.
*   **VPC Support:** App Engine Flex allows you to connect to your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), which can be useful for more complex applications.
*   **Background Tasks:** It supports background tasks and long-running processes.

## Recommendation for Teaching

For this teaching exercise, **I recommend starting with Cloud Run**. Its simplicity and fast deployment times make it an excellent tool for introducing students to serverless container deployment on Google Cloud. The concepts learned with Cloud Run (containerization, secret management, and IAM) are directly transferable to other services like GKE and App Engine.

Once students are comfortable with Cloud Run, you can introduce App Engine as a next step to demonstrate a different deployment model with more configuration options.
