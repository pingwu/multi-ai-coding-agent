# Team Collaboration Architecture - Project 04

## üéØ Business Objectives

### Problem Statement
Teams struggle to stay focused and accountable when ideas are "all over the place." This application helps **two-pizza teams** (5-8 people) maintain focus through collaborative task tracking with individual accountability.

### Target Users
- **Small Teams**: 2-8 people (two-pizza rule)
- **Project Managers**: Need visibility into who's doing what
- **Team Members**: Want clear accountability and focus
- **Students**: Learning Google OAuth SSO implementation

## üìä Enhanced Google Sheets Schema

### Current Project 3 Schema (Single Sheet)
Based on `project-03-task-tracker`, the current schema has these columns:

| Col | Field | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| A | task_id | Unique identifier |
| B | title | Task description |
| C | status | NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, BLOCKED |
| D | category | DEVELOPMENT, MEETING, DOCUMENTATION, etc. |
| E | priority | LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL |
| F | created_date | ISO timestamp when created |
| G | updated_date | ISO timestamp when last updated |
| H | due_date | Optional due date |
| I | notes | Additional notes |
| J | last_update_action | Timestamped action log |
| K | motivation_type | INTRINSIC, EXTRINSIC, MIXED |
| L | parent_item_id | Optional parent task ID |
| M | last_updated_date | Duplicate of updated_date |
| N | last_update_message | Brief update message |

### Project 4 Extended Schema - Two Sheets Approach

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Authentication Flow (Teaching Point #1: OAuth 2.0)
```
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Redirect to Google OAuth consent screen
3. User authorizes application access
4. Google returns authorization code
5. Exchange code for access token + user profile
6. Store user session and profile
7. All API calls include user context
```

### Data Flow with User Identity (Teaching Point #2: Audit Trail)
```
Frontend (React) ‚Üí FastAPI Backend ‚Üí Google Sheets API
     ‚Üì                    ‚Üì                ‚Üì
User Profile      Add user metadata     Sheet updates with
  (OAuth)         to all operations      user attribution
     ‚Üì                    ‚Üì                ‚Üì
Session Storage   User context in API   Audit trail logging
```

### Google Sheets Operations (Teaching Point #3: Service Account + User Auth)
- **Sheet Owner**: Uses service account for sheet creation/management
- **User Operations**: All task operations include user email attribution
- **Dual-Sheet Strategy**: Main tasks + audit trail for complete accountability
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket notifications for team coordination

## üîê Security Architecture

### Authentication Layers
1. **Google OAuth 2.0**: User identity verification
2. **JWT Session Management**: Secure token storage with refresh
3. **API Authorization**: Verify user permissions per request
4. **Google Sheets Access**: Service account + user attribution

### Permission Model
- **Team Lead**: Can invite/remove members, manage sheet permissions, view all audit logs
- **Team Member**: Can create/update own tasks, view team tasks, limited audit access
- **Guest**: Read-only access to shared sheets

## üìà Enhanced Data Models

## üìã Migration Strategy from Project 3

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing Project 3 functionality remains intact
- Current single-user sheets can be "adopted" by teams
- Gradual migration path from individual to team usage

### Data Migration Steps
1. **Sheet Backup**: Create backup of existing Project 3 data
2. **Column Extension**: Add new columns M-P to existing sheet
3. **Audit Sheet Creation**: Add second "AuditTrail" sheet
4. **Default User Assignment**: Assign existing tasks to sheet owner
5. **Audit Backfill**: Create audit entries for existing tasks

This architecture provides a comprehensive foundation for teaching modern web authentication, team collaboration patterns, and audit trail implementation while building on the solid foundation of Project 3.
