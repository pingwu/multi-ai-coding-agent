# ðŸš€ Your Learning Path: From Zero to AI-Augmented Developer

This guide outlines a 12-week journey to transform you from a beginner into a job-ready, AI-augmented developer with a professional portfolio.

### **Phase 1: Setup & First Wins (Week 1)**

Your goal this week is to get your environment set up and experience your first "aha!" moment.

1.  **[Install AI Coding Environment](./setup/quick-start.md)** â€” Get Claude Code, Docker, and other essential development tools installed on your machine.
2.  **Run Your First Project** â€” Start with the **[Content Generator](./project-01-content-generator/)**. Follow the instructions to get it running. The goal is not to understand every line of code, but to experience the power of an AI-augmented workflow firsthand.
3.  **Understand the Workflow** â€” Pay attention to how you use natural language to instruct the AI agent. Notice the pattern: you describe *what* you want, and the agent handles the *how*.
4.  **[Spec-Driven Development Session](./setup/spec-driven-development-session.md)** â€” Read this overview to understand the concept of spec-driven development, which will be a key part of your workflow in the coming weeks.

### **Phase 2: Build, Customize, & Learn (Weeks 2-8)**

This is the core of your learning journey. You will work through the portfolio projects, customizing them to make them your own.

1.  **Clone and Customize Each Project:** For each project in the portfolio, your task is to use natural language instructions to modify it. Treat the AI agent as your development partner.
2.  **Add Your Own Features:** This is where you get creative. Don't just follow the instructions; make the projects your own. For example:
    *   *"Turn the Task Tracker into a study planner for college students."*
    *   *"Add a feature to the Expense Tracker that categorizes spending by vendor."*
    *   *"Modify the Content Generator to write in the style of my favorite author."*
3.  **Deploy to Production:** Follow the guides to deploy your customized applications to the web. The goal is to have live URLs for each of your projects that you can share with potential employers or clients.

### **Phase 3: Portfolio, Professional Story, & Job Search (Weeks 9-12)**

Now it's time to package your new skills and experience into a compelling professional narrative.

1.  **Create Your AI-Augmented Developer Story:** You are not just another developer. You are an AI-augmented developer who can build and deploy applications faster and more efficiently. Craft your resume and LinkedIn profile to reflect this unique strength.
2.  **Showcase Your Unique Workflow:** Prepare to talk about *how* you build. In interviews, you can explain that you focus on architecture and problem-solving while leveraging AI agents for implementation. This is a major differentiator.
3.  **Target Forward-Thinking Companies:** Seek out companies that value innovation and efficiency. These are the employers who will recognize the power of your AI-augmented skills and be willing to pay a premium for them.
