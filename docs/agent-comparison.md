### **Choosing Your Coding Agent**

**For Beginners:** Start with **Cursor Agent** or **Copilot Agent** - they provide the most intuitive learning experience with immediate feedback and suggestions.

**For Advanced Projects:** Use **Claude Code**, **DeepAgent**, or **Gemini CLI** - they excel at complex architecture decisions and comprehensive code analysis.

**For Autonomous Development:** Try **DeepAgent** - it specializes in multi-step reasoning and autonomous code generation, ideal for complex workflows requiring minimal supervision.

**For Team Development:** Consider **Trae AI** - it offers superior collaboration features and enterprise-grade project management capabilities.

**For Open Source:** **Codex CLI** provides excellent code generation quality and integrates well with popular development workflows.

### **Multi-Agent Workflow**

The most powerful approach is using multiple agents strategically:

1.  **Cursor Agent** for real-time coding assistance
2.  **Claude Code** for architecture and code review
3.  **DeepAgent** for autonomous multi-step implementation
4.  **Gemini CLI** for comprehensive project analysis
5.  **Copilot Agent** for GitHub integration and version control

This multi-agent approach leverages each tool's strengths while building a comprehensive AI-augmented development environment.

**Example Workflow:**
- **Planning Phase:** Claude Code (architecture) + Gemini CLI (codebase analysis)
- **Implementation Phase:** DeepAgent (autonomous coding) + Cursor Agent (real-time assistance)
- **Review Phase:** Claude Code (quality review) + Copilot Agent (PR integration)
